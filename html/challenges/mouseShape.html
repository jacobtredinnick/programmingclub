		<h1>Challenge - Mouse Shape</h1>

		<h3>Task</h3>
		<p><b>Draw a rectangle that follows the mouse position:</b><p></p>
		<img src="/programmingclub/img/mouseShape.png"/>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Objective</h3>
		<p><b>Learn about setup(), draw() and mouse position</b></p>
		<p>Most processing programs use setup() and draw().  We will introduce them here, along with a way of using the mouse position.</p>

		<h3>Tools</h3>
		<li>The <b><a href="http://processing.org/reference/setup_">setup()</a></b> function is a special function that Processing calls once at the start of the program.</li><p></p>
		<li>The <b><a href="http://processing.org/reference/draw_">draw()</a></b> function is a speci</li><p></p>
		<li>The <b><a href="http://processing.org/reference/mouseX">mouseX</a></b> and <b><a href="http://processing.org/reference/mouseY">mouseY</a></b>
		variables hold the current position of the mouse in the Processing window</li><p></p>
		<li><b>Hint:</b> The program below shows a <b>circle</b> moving with the mouse.  This is explained in the comments.  Change it to use a rectangle instead of a circle:</li><p></p>

		<pre><code><b>
// constants don't change value during the whole program
// By convention we use capitals for these names
int SCREEN_WIDTH = 800;
int SCREEN_HEIGHT = 800;
int CIRCLE_WIDTH = 100;

// setup() is a special function in Processing
// it is called by Processing, only once at the start of the program
void setup()
{
  // using constants instead of size(800,800) makes the program easier to understand
  size(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT);
  
  // the smooth() function makes graphics draw more - well - smoothly
  // it just takes a bit longer to draw them - but you usually won't notice
  smooth();
}

// draw() is a special function in Processing
// it is called by Processing, many times per second
// every time the draw function draws, it is called a "frame"
// use draw() to animate things in the processing window, by drawing something a little different in each frame
void draw()
{
  // background(0) overwrites everything black, every time draw is called (each frame)
  background(0);
 
  // the circle will be red - we've done this before
  fill(255,0,0); 
 
  // mouseX and mouseY are Processing variables that hold the current mouse position
  // ellipse(x,y,width,height) is used to draw an ellipse at (x,y) with the specified width and height
  // an ellipse with the same width and height is a circle
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, CIRCLE_WIDTH, CIRCLE_WIDTH);
