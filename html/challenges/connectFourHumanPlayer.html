		<h1>Challenge - Connect Four Human Player</h1>
		<h3>Task</h3>
		<p>
		<b>Place the pieces into the grid using the mouse.</b><br>
		In this challenge we will allow a human player to place the pieces into the game grid.  This will be a lot easier than making the computer play!<br>
		Here are the requirements:<br>
		<li>The yellow and red players take turns.  Yellow starts.</li>
		<li>When the <b>mouse</b> is <b>moved</b> near the first empty slot in a column, that slot will be highlighted with a lighter version of the player's colour.</li>
		<li>When the <b>mouse</b> is <b>clicked</b>, that player's colour will be placed in the first empty slot in that column.</li>
		<li>Clicks in a full column will be ignored.</li>
		</p>
		<h3>Tools</h3>
		<p>The <a href="/programmingclub/examples/connectFourHumanPlayerStarterProgram/connectFourHumanPlayerStarterProgram.txt">
		starter</a> program has the grid from the last challenge, but it has been reworked to use some helper code and leaves a few hints...</p>
		</p>
		<pre><code><b>
void draw() {
  // draw the current state of the grid, based on the model
  drawGrid();
  
  // draw a preview in a colour based on the current player
  // HINT: Use the Connect Four model (grid object) and drawing helper code to find the cell at the current mouse position and draw a preview
}

void mouseClicked() {
  // HINT: Use the Connect Four model (grid object) to set the piece in the slot clicked and then change the player
}

// YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO MODIFY ANY CODE BELOW THIS LINE - JUST USE IT
		</pre></code></b>
		<p>For a program like this, it is common to split up some of the code into a "model".
		The model is a representation of the state of the game at any time which can be modified, but does not know about any moving of the mouse or drawing of the grid.
		In this way, a complicated program can be split up into easier to understand pieces.
		</p>
		<p>The most basic thing to model is the content of any of the slots.  Don't worry if you don't recognize some of the keywords below:
		</p>
		<pre><code><b>
// Let's call the circular gaps in the Connect Four grid "slots"
// Each slot can either be empty, yellow or red.
// (this would normally be an "enumerated type" but processing seems not to support these yet)
class SlotType {
  public static final int EMPTY = 0;
  public static final int YELLOW = 1;
  public static final int RED = 2;
}
		</pre></code></b>
		<p>
		There are many ways in which we could model the game.
		Our drawing code should only deal with the Grid type, which currently has enough functions on it to allow us to draw an empty one.
		To understand how it works, read the comments above each function.  You can see these functions being called in the drawing code.
		</p>
		<pre><code><b>
class Grid {
  ...
  
  // create a grid with all slots empty
  Grid(int rows, int columns) {
  ...
  
  // get the number of rows in this grid
  int getNumRows() {
  ...
  
  // get the number of columns in this grid
  int getNumCols() {
  ...
 
  // get the content of a specified slot as an integer code that should match one of the SlotType values
  // rows & columns are "indexed" starting at 0
  // the leftmost column is column 0 and the bottom row is row 0 
  int getSlot(int row, int col) {
  ...
  
  // gets the index of the first empty slot in a specified column
  // returns -1 if the column has no empty slots
  int getFirstEmptySlot(int col) {
  ...
  
  // set a (yellow or red) piece into the specified slot
  // ignoring gravity for now - this is currently handled by the client calling getFirstEmptySlot
  void set(int row, int col, int type) {
  ...
		</pre></code></b>
		<h3>Example <a id="displayText" href="javascript:toggle();">(Show)</a></h1>
		<div id="toggleText" style="display: none">
		<p>Here is some code that will draw the preview and place the pieces using the existing helper code:</p>
		<pre><code><b>
void draw() {
  // first draw the current state of the grid, based on the model
  drawGrid();
  
  // draw a preview in a colour based on the current player
  int col = getActiveColumn(mouseX, grid.getNumCols());
  int row = grid.getFirstEmptySlot(col);	
    if (row != -1) {
    drawCellPreview(row, col);
  }
}

void mouseClicked() {
  // place a piece if the column was valid and change player
  int col = getActiveColumn(mouseX, grid.getNumCols());
  int row = grid.getFirstEmptySlot(col);
  if (row != -1) { // check column is not full
    grid.set(row, col, player);
    if (player == SlotType.YELLOW) {
      player = SlotType.RED;
    }
    else {
      player = SlotType.YELLOW;
    }
  }
}

		</pre></code></b>
