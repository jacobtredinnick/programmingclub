		<h1>Challenge - Noughts And Crosses - Random Game</h1>

		<h3>Task</h3>
		<p><b>Draw a line through the winning move</b><p></p>
		<img src="/programmingclub/img/noughtsAndCrossesRandomGame.png"/>

		<h3>Objective</h3>
		<p><b>Make the gameplay work according to the rules, with random computer moves</b></p>

		<h3>Tools</h3>
		<p>The <a href="/programmingclub/examples/noughtsAndCrossesRandomGameStarterProgram/noughtsAndCrossesRandomGameStarterProgram.txt">
		starter program</a>	contains a working noughts and crosses game.  Copy this to a new program and run it to see.</p>
		<p>The program already calls the drawWin() method below when it detects a win.
		You have to "implement" this method to draw something that indicates a win - like a line.
		Read the comments in the code for more clues.</p>
		<p>To test it, you just have to beat the computer but don't worry - the computer is currently a rubbish player!
		(but we will work on that another time...)</p>
		<pre><code><b>
  // draw a line through the winning 3 squares: (x0,y0) --> (x1,y1)
  void drawWin(GameWin win) {
    // win.player is NOUGHT or CROSS - use this to decide what to draw
    // (win.x0, win.y0) is the (x,y) index of the first square of the 3
    // (win.x1, win.y1) is the (x,y) index of the last square of the 3
    // use convertIndexToPoint to convert an index to an on-screen point to draw
    // HINT: it will be easier to draw a line based on the centres of the winning squares (use squareWidth to find the centre)
  }
		</pre></code></b>

		<p>The <a href="/programmingclub/solutions/noughtsAndCrossesRandomGame/noughtsAndCrossesRandomGame.txt">solution</a>
		program implements the drawWin() method as follows.  First set the stroke and strokeWeight depending on the player, then draw a line between the centres of the winning squares:
		<pre><code><b>
  // draw a line through the winning 3 squares: (x0,y0) --> (x1,y1)
  void drawWin(GameWin win) {
    // win.player is NOUGHT or CROSS - use this to decide what to draw
    // (win.x0, win.y0) is the (x,y) index of the first square of the 3
    // (win.x1, win.y1) is the (x,y) index of the last square of the 3
    // use convertIndexToPoint to conver an index to an on-screen point to draw
    // HINT: it will be easier to draw a line based on the centres of the winning squares (use squareWidth to find the centre)

    strokeWeight(STROKE_WEIGHT);
    if (win.player == NOUGHT) {
      stroke(NOUGHT_COLOR);
    }
    else {
      stroke(CROSS_COLOR);
    }

    int x0 = convertIndexToPoint(win.x0) + squareWidth/2;
    int y0 = convertIndexToPoint(win.y0) + squareWidth/2;
    int x1 = convertIndexToPoint(win.x1) + squareWidth/2;
    int y1 = convertIndexToPoint(win.y1) + squareWidth/2;
    line(x0,y0,x1,y1);
  }		</pre></code></b>
