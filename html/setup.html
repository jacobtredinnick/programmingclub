		<h1>Setup</h1>
		<p>We will be using <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>, which is a simplified environment for 
		<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html">Java</a>, a popular programming language used today.</p>
		<p>Processing was originally designed as visual environment in whick to learn basic computer programming,
		but is also now widely used by artists and designers to produce professional work.</p>
		<p>Processing should already be set up on your computer in the club.  Just double click "Processing.exe" to run the tool.</p>
		<p>If you have access to a computer at home,
		you can follow the download instructions <a href = "http://processing.org/download/">here</a> and try the examples in your own time.</p>
