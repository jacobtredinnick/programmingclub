Code snippets and a basic website used to run a small programming club at the local school

## Background
A few years back (around 2013-5 I think) I developed the code samples and simple website here, in order to run a small programming club at the local school.  The club was aimed at pupils aged 10-16 and assumed no programming background.  I'm no longer running the club, but putting the code samples & website here in case anyone else out there can find a use for it!

## Language Choice - Processing
The first basic choice when setting up this club was: **Which programming language(s) to use?**

Important requirements for the language choice in this situation were:
* It should be quick for someone with no experience to get something working
* The language should not be overly complex at it's introductory level
* Yet it should still be relevant to modern-day programming languages & software development

Based on this, I selected [Processing](https://processing.org/), which (as I understand it) aims to meet the aims above within the context of visual arts.  IMHO I felt that this environment also met the needs of my pupils - for example the "Hello World" in Processing is a one-liner allowing the user to display some sort of graphics & with a few more lines we can add some simple animation which is very appealing to youngsters trying to code for the first time!

Since writing the course content I'm sure that other languages have moved on, as has Processing.  At the time I was using Processing 2 and I haven't tested any of the content with Processing 3.

Note: Most of the content so far is based on Processing but there are a couple of "Challenges" using HTML, CSS and some rudimentary JavaScript.

## Website - Static HTML
The format of the course was to deploy a simple, static HTML website on the school's internal network.  The website is rudimentary and I've no doubt that the content could be made a lot more appealing (and a little less 90s-looking :wink:) with a little effort!

## How the sessions were run
Just in case anyone happens across this or is thinking of setting up something similar, this is how I ran the club:
* First of all I was lucky enough to have a supportive employer & manager who allowed me flexible working time in ordre to run this club during school hours!
* Each year the club was advertised as a weekly, 1 hour after-school club, running for 8 weeks
* At each session I would aim to get through 2 or 3 of the "challenges"
* Each challenge was described as a separate page in the website which I would (very) briefly explain before letting the students attempt it and helping them all out individually
* Students were encouraged to tinker with the solutions and try to make something fun!

## How to deploy the website
I'll update this section once I've committed the code & website samples...
