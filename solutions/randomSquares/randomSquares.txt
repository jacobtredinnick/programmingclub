// By convention we use capitals in the variable names to show this.

  // pick a random point on the screen to draw the square
  // a "float" is a number that might not be a whole number
  // we need to use a float here because that is what the random() function returns
  float x = random(SCREEN_WIDTH); // random number between 0 and SCREEN_WIDTH
  float y = random(SCREEN_HEIGHT); // random number between 0 and SCREEN_HEIGHT

  // pick a random width, but not bigger than the maximum

// note that we can write our own functions
// this is useful if we want to do something more than once, or just to make it easier to read the rest of the program
// the function name should describe what it does
// the "void" part before the name means that the function does return anything to the caller
// don't worry about the () part after the name for now - this will be explained later!
