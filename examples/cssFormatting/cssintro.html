<p>
Here is some text inside an HTML <xmp><p></xmp> tag, it has no formatting.
The <xmp><p></xmp> tags keep this text seperate from the text in the other <xmp><p></xmp> tags
</p>

<p style="background-color:red">
Here is some more text, this time we have added <xmp>style="background-color:red"</xmp> to the <xmp><p></xmp> tag.
<xmp>style</xmp> is called an "attribute" of the <xmp><p></xmp> tag.
When you look at the page in your browser you will see the background colour has gone red - but it only affects this <xmp><p></xmp> tag"
</p>

<p style="border-style:solid; ">
Here is another example text with a different style - it has a black outline around it"
</p>

<p style="background-color:blue; border-style:dashed; border-width:5">
This paragraph combines two styles - it has a background colour and a box surrounding it. it
</p>

<p style="border-style:solid; text-align:center; margin-top:30px; margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px; margin-bottom:30px">
Can you see why this paragraph has a different layout to the previous ones
